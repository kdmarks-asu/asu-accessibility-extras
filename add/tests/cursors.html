<h1>Types of Cursors</h1>

<h2>PC Cursor</h2>
<p>The PC cursor is the cursor, or the caret, on the screen. 
When PC cursor is active in JAWS, pressing arrow keys moves the caret on the screen.
When PC cursor is active, users cannot go to any part of the screen where the caret cannotbe placed. For example, users cannot use the PC cursor to go up and read the title bar. This, however, is most commonly used cursor, and is sufficent in most tasks.	The Virtual PC cursor is similar to the PC cursor except that the caret is not affected by key press.</p>


<h2>Virtual PC Cursor</h2>
<p>When Internet Explorer is started, the Virtual PC cursor becomes active. In this mode, users can use the arrow keys to read through the document opened by the Internet Explorer, even though the caret on the screen does not move. Users can select, and cut/copy and paste using the shift key and the arrow keys just as in the PC cursor mode.	JAWS cursor is linked to the mouse pointer. When the JAWS cursor is active in JAWS, preesing arrow keys causes the mouse pointer to move, and at the same time, the part where the mouse pointer is moved to is read by JAWS.</p>

<h2>JAWS Cursor</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of the JAWS cursor it to allow users to read part of the screen where the PC cursor cannot go to. This sometimes helps users to have a good understanding of how things are laid out in the window. At the same time, it can be used to emulate mouse operations. For example, when there is a button that cannot be activated by any keyboard operation, users can find it by moving the JAWS cursor, and click on the button using the mouse button emulation keys. The mouse emulation keys are the ``/'' and the ``*'' keys on the numpad, and they are equivalent to let mouse button and right mouse button respectively.
When the JAWS cursor is active, users must keep in mind that pressing the arrow keys does not affect the caret on the screen. Thus, it is not possible to select, and cut/copy and paste using the shift key and the arrow keys when the JAWS cursor is active.</p>
