    <h1>Color Contrast</h1>
<p>Most of us will have trouble with our vision at some point in our lives, whether from a permanent or temporary condition. Web pages and applications that use insufficient color contrast introduce barriers to people with vision limitations.</p>
<p>The W3C recommends a minimum color-contrast ratio for normal sized text of 4.5:1 and 3:1 for large text. </p>
<h2>Low Vision</h2>
<p>Low vision is characterized as having a visual acuity of 20/40 that cannot be corrected by glasses alone. About 4% of the population have low vision, but the numbers increase with age. By age 40, most of us will need reading glasses to see small objects or text clearly, a condition called presbyopia. By age 50, half of us will have some type of low-vision condition.</p>
<p>This is what the ASU homepage looks like to people with typical vision disorders.</p>

<h2>Color Blindness</h2>

<p>About 8% of men and 1% of women have some form of visual color deficiency. The most widespread types of color blindness are green (deuteranopia) and red (protanopia) deficiency. Blue deficiency (tritanopia) is less common. People with color blindness benefit greatly from high color-contrast ratios.</p>
<p>This is what the ASU homepage looks like to people with these types of color blindness.</p>
