<h2>The Rehabilitation Act of 1973</h2>
<h3>Section 504</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>"No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>--<a href="https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/sec504.htm">Section 504, 29 U.S.C.§794, Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/sec504.htm">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a> is an anti-discrimination, civil rights statute. It prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in federal programs and services, including entities that receive federal funds (e.g., higher education institutions that receive federal grants and student financial aid).</p>
<p>Under Section 504, university students, staff, faculty, and visitors with disabilities cannot be denied access to programs and services due to inaccessible technology.</p>
<p>In 2010, the Department of Justice made the following statement: "There is no doubt that the Internet sites of state and local government entities are covered by Title II of the ADA. Similarly, there is no doubt that the websites of recipients of federal financial assistance are covered by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The DOJ has affirmed the application of these statutes to Internet sites...in numerous agreements with state and local governments and recipients of federal financial assistance."</p>

<h3>Section 508</h3>
<p>Although limited to federal agencies, <a href="https://www.section508.gov/">Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a> is an extremely influential piece of legislation because it outlined the first enforceable US federal IT accessibility standards to which state governments and businesses could be held accountable.</p>
<p>On January 18, 2018, the <em>Revised</em> Section 508 standards went into effect, adopting the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> as the standard for the web and IT technologies.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>The Americans with Disability Act</h2>
<p><img class="fl-right" src="images/capitol.jpg" alt=" ">The <a href="https://www.ada.gov/">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a> was passed in 1990 before the advent of the Internet, but some of the act’s key provisions apply to public institutions.</p>
<p>Title II of the ADA requires that communications to people with disabilities be equally as effective as communications with non-disabled people in their timeliness, accuracy, and delivery method. </p>
<p>Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in places of accommodation, including businesses, places of entertainment, the offices of service providers, and public (and some private) educational institutions.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice has stated that the ADA applies to technology in higher education and has made clear through legal precedent that the IT systems of public universities must comply with the industry-standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> 2.1, level AA. </p>
