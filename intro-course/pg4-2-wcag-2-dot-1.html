    <h1>WCAG 2.1</h1>
<p>In 1999, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> first published the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>, which soon became the internationally recognized industry standard for creating accessible websites and applications.  If followed, these standards ensure the Internet is accessible to people of all abilities.</p>
<p><strong>At ASU, all new and redesigned web content, applications, and sites must comply with WCAG 2.1, level AA.</strong></p>
<p> </p>

<p>WCAG 2.1 consists of twelve guidelines organized under four principles: To be accessible, websites must be <em>P</em>erceivable,<em> O</em>perable, <em>U</em>nderstandable, and <em>R</em>obust (POUR).</p>
<p>Technology providers must ensure that all their users can <strong>perceive</strong>, <strong>operate</strong>, and <strong>understand</strong> their technology and that the technology is <strong>robust</strong> enough to work across a spectrum of technologies, including assistive technology.</p>

<h2>Perceivable</h2>
<p><strong>Is there anything on the site, application or document that a user may not be able to perceive?</strong></p>
<p>Perceivability means the user can identify content and interface elements by means of the senses. Accessible content allows for multiple perceptive methods, such as visual, auditory, and tactile.</p>

<h2>Operable</h2>
<p><strong>Can the user physically operate (use) the site, application or document?</strong></p>
<p>Operability means that a user can successfully use controls, buttons, navigation, and other interactive elements using multiple methods, including clicking and tapping, as well as using a computer keyboard and voice commands.</p>

<h2>Understandable</h2>
<p><strong>Can the user understand the content and how to interact with the site, application or document?</strong></p>
<p>Understandable technology is consistent in its presentation and format, predictable in its design and usage patterns, concise, multimodal, and appropriate to the audience in its voice and tone.</p>

<h2>Robust</h2>
<p><strong>Is the site supported by all browsers and devices? Does it adapt to different sized screens?</strong></p>
<p>Robust content works well on all major operating systems, browsers, and devices. Users should be free to choose the technology that works best for them and their needs, including their accessibility needs.</p>
