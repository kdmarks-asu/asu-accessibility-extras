    <h1>What You Can Do?</h1>
<p>Whatever your role in the IT process, you can contribute directly to accessibility efforts in your group. You can start by learning several easy core skills that will generally improve the experience of assistive technology users, people with non­apparent disabilities, and the general population. Here are some ideas for getting started:</p>
<h2>Create accessible digital documents and websites</h2>
<h3>Add headings</h3>
<p>Headings provide structure to your documents by describing topic and subtopic areas in an outline fashion. Use "real" headings (not just a different font) with the Styles Pane in MS Word documents and the Accessibility tool in Adobe Acrobat for PDFs, as well as the heading tags on HTML pages. Headings make all documents more usable and navigable by assistive technology, as well as by bookmark and Table of Contents users.</p>
<h3>Use semantic lists</h3>
<p>Ordered (sequential or numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists present items or information in a sequence for the user. If your digital content includes lists, make sure they are made using actual list markup. In software and web WYSIWYG (rich-text) toolbars, always use the list buttons to create lists.</p>
<h3>Use color and contrast appropriately</h3>
<p>Color can liven up a document, but some users can't distinguish the meaning of an object based on color alone. Make sure that your designs and content do not rely solely on color to convey their meaning; always include a text description as well.</p>
<h3>Check your digital media for captions and transcripts</h3>
<p>If you post digital media, check to ensure that the media includes captions (for video) or a transcript (for audio). Captions should accurately reflect onscreen sounds and dialogue and also should be synchronized with the content on the screen.</p>
<h3>Check your images and graphics for text alternatives</h3>
<p>Images, infographics, charts, and other digital graphics in documents and webpages are not accessible to many people. If you use images in documents or email, be sure to provide descriptive ALT text, captions, summaries, or other text alternatives for users who cannot see or otherwise experience the images.</p>
<h3>Use a tool to check for accessibility</h3>
<p>Numerous free resources are available to help you check the accessibility of your websites. The <a href="https://siteimprove.com/en-us/core-platform/integrations/browser-extensions/">Siteimprove Chrome browser extension</a> for<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-browser-exten/amoojkmllfodlpgmdnclkgdnejgpeada?hl=en"> Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/digital-certainty-index/">Firefox</a>, the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/">WAVE toolbar</a>, the <a href="https://khan.github.io/tota11y/">Tota11y extension</a>, and other tools can provide some insight into your website’s compliance with accessibility standards and guidelines. Meanwhile, some desktop applications like Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Adobe Acrobat include onboard checkers to help you identify and address accessibility problems in documents. If you create online documents, learn to use accessibility checkers and correct any issues before distributing documents.</p>
<h2>Purchase and procure accessible technology</h2>
<p>If you purchase or otherwise acquire new technology for your unit, do some market research to learn about the accessibility of the products you're considering. Ask vendors about voluntary product accessibility templates (VPATs) and other accessibility strategies. Find out whether products have been tested with assistive technology.</p>
<h2>Ask "What about accessibility?"</h2>
<p>Whatever your role in supporting technology, make sure that accessibility is part of the conversation.</p>
<p>Ask vendors to provide information on their accessibility efforts, make accessibility a project requirement, educate yourself on accessibility efforts in your department or at ASU. If you are in a position of leadership, encourage others to consider accessibility and green­light accessibility training and professional development for your staff.</p>
