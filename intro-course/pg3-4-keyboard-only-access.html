<p>Imagine that one day you break your computer mouse, or hurt your hand and can't hold a mouse...or catch pink eye from the neighbor kids and your screen is blurry. In all these scenarios, you might be compelled to rely on your computer's keyboard to navigate the Internet. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For people with low or no vision or who have mobility limitations, using a mouse is often impossible. They must rely exclusively on the keyboard (or assistive technology with keyboard-like functionality). This is why it's so important for web developers to test their websites and applications to make sure they function as well <em>without a mouse</em> as they do with one.</p>

<h2>Keyboard-Only Exercise</h2>

<p>Put aside your mouse (or refrain from using your touchpad). Use only:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Tab key:</strong> to move forward (use Shift + Tab to reverse)</li>
<li>
<strong>Arrow keys:</strong> to move around in widgets like menus</li>
<li>
<strong>Enter/Return key or Space bar:</strong> to select</li>
<li>
<strong>Escape key:</strong> to close popup windows or when desperate</li>
</ul>

<p>You may use your mouse to click on the links, but when the page opens, use only your keyboard to navigate:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://weather.com/" target="_blank">https://weather.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.prevention.com/" target="_blank">https://www.prevention.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/" target="_blank">https://www.wsj.com/</a></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h3>How did you do?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Could you tell where you were on the page at all times? (A focus indicator, usually a dotted or blue border, should be present as you tab.)</li>
<li>Could you close popup windows?</li>
<li>Could you get to menus and select menu items?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you thought the exercise was frustrating, you aren't alone. For people with motor or vision disabilities, navigating the Internet with only their keyboard is frequently a precarious venture.</p>
