    <h1>Alt Text</h1>
<p>Last year we renovated our house, which involved ripping out the walls. Imagine our surprise when we took down a wall and found a metal box hidden between the studs. Believe it or not, here's what we found:</p>

<div class="fake-image"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Are you having trouble identifying the items in the above photo?</p>
<p>This is what people with vision impairments face when images are not provided with alternative text. Although people with vision limitations may not be able to "see" the image, their screen reader could have read the image's "alt tag" to them, thus ensuring they received the same information as sighted users.</p>
<p>In addition, alt tags help people with slow Internet connections, can be indexed by search engines to improve SEO, and are used if an image file is missing.</p>
<p>When the content creator went back and supplied alt text, this is what the underlying code looked like:</p>
<pre>&lt;img src="/images/4569.jpg" alt="Metal box containing a newspaper, DVD,<br>45 rpm record, flip phone, and dot-matrix print out." /&gt;</pre>
<p><span>Search engines, people on slow connections, and users without vision now had the same access to the content as everyone else:</span></p>
<div class="fake-image">Metal box containing a newspaper, DVD, 45 rpm record, flip phone, and dot-matrix print out.</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Much better!</p>
