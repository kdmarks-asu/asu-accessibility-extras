<p>As dry as they may seem, it's important to know the regulations and standards that apply to ASU's web sites, applications, and content. Laws such as the <a href="https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Rehabilitation%20Act%20Of%201973.pdf">Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a> and the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm">Americans with Disability Act</a> were created to protect the rights of disabled persons and are being applied to all types of electronic information technology.</p> 
<p>For internet accessibility, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> is the standard cited by the Department of Justice for their web accessibility rulings and the standard ASU complies with for all its digital content.</p>
